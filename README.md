# Grave – skeleton directory generator

## Synopsis

```
$ grave <dir-name>
```

## Description

This is an experimental sketch of a program for generating a "skeleton
directory" with boilerplate files.

It currently just copies files from `.grave/default`, but will probably get
more features in the future, like generation from a template.

## Examples

Generate files in the directory 'foo':

```
$ grave foo
foo/LICENSE
foo/README.md
```
